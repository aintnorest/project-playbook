# Review an implementation plan

## Role

Independently review one implementation plan's task graph; do not edit it, approve it, redesign the work, or implement it.

## Purpose

Find consequential defects that would cause a task executor to start blocked, build atop an undefined exit state, miss approved work, smuggle a new product or architecture decision into a task, or ship a task that looks complete but leaves behavior unimplemented. Assess directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) structural correctness, two-way coverage of the technical design, per-task verifiability, prerequisite and shared-file ownership, and boundary discipline, without imposing a task size or slicing the contract does not require.

## Required guidance

- [Independent review context](../guides/document-review.md#independent-review-context)
- [Evidence and authority](../guides/document-review.md#evidence-and-authority)
- [Findings](../guides/document-review.md#findings)
- [Implementation plan contract](../guides/product-documentation-process.md#implementation-plan)

## Reference guidance

- [Document state and revision](../guides/product-documentation-process.md#document-state-and-revision)
- [Reference over repetition](../guides/product-documentation-process.md#reference-over-repetition)
- [Communication rules](../guides/communication-policy.md#rules)

## Inputs

- Target path, exact revision or unambiguous candidate body, and review scope.
- The source Technical Design Document (TDD) it plans, its approval, and the requirements, scenarios, and technical contracts it establishes.
- Available repository code, schemas, configuration, tests, and verification conventions needed to check concrete task targets, commands, and existing symbols.
- For a follow-up, prior findings and dispositions. Omit them for an independent first pass.

## Instructions

Before checking status, read [document state and revision](../guides/product-documentation-process.md#document-state-and-revision). For an accessible candidate file, run `check_doc_status` as well as `check_implementation_plan`; include frontmatter errors as exact review evidence, not a substitute for substantive review. If the status tool is unavailable or the candidate is chat-only, state that its check was not run and the resulting coverage limit. `## Status`, if present, is prose only; metadata belongs in top-of-file YAML frontmatter.

1. **Establish the review basis.** Identify the exact plan candidate and its source TDD path and revision. With file access, read the plan, the TDD, and only the repository evidence needed to verify concrete task targets, symbols, and verification commands. In chat, use supplied source content; a path or link alone is not evidence. Treat an unavailable source as a precise coverage limit, not as a candidate defect. Confirm the TDD approval the plan depends on rather than inferring it.
2. **Derive a bounded coverage map.** Before judging defects, enumerate the TDD's applicable requirements, acceptance scenarios, and technical contracts, and enumerate the plan's tasks with their identifiers, targets, and direct prerequisites. Map only obligations the approved TDD establishes. Do not import unapproved future work, generic engineering tasks, or requirements the TDD does not carry.
3. **Check task shape and DAG structural correctness.** Check every task block against the [implementation plan contract](../guides/product-documentation-process.md#implementation-plan): heading and unique ID, required labels and optional `Protects` immediately after `Targets` (before `Change`) and `Tests` after `Change`, in their prescribed order, nonempty fields, ID-only one-line `Depends on`, and immediately nested reasons matching its direct IDs in order. Confirm these edges form an acyclic graph for which a topological order exists, that every prerequisite identifier resolves to a real earlier task, that no task depends on itself, and that each edge names the required output or hard ordering constraint it supplies rather than a vague "when ready." Flag malformed task blocks as well as a cycle, dangling prerequisite, or edge asserted without a real need.
   When the candidate plan file is accessible, run the `check_implementation_plan` tool's static check before reporting; use its deterministic errors as evidence alongside substantive review, not as a substitute for it. If the tool is unavailable, state the unperformed static check as a concrete coverage limit; a manual check does not pass that gate. For a chat-only candidate without an accessible file, check the supplied text manually and state the tool check was not run.
   For the static check pass `mode: "check"` and `plan: <path>` only to `check_implementation_plan`; omit `repo`, `base`, `head`, and `task` (protected-diff arguments).
4. **Check coverage of the design in both directions.** Confirm every applicable TDD requirement, scenario, and technical contract maps to at least one task or is an explicit, justified non-goal, and that every task traces to a TDD obligation. Flag missing work that leaves a requirement unbuilt, and a task with no TDD reference as unauthorized scope. Tasks reference the requirement, scenario, or contract by identifier or heading rather than copying its text.
   When checking whether a task references rather than copies its owning obligation, read [reference over repetition](../guides/product-documentation-process.md#reference-over-repetition).
   Confirm acceptance-test tasks reference approved TDD scenarios, precede implementation tasks, and are prerequisites of the implementation they guard; their checks should run and fail for the specified missing behavior. Semantically flag every acceptance-test task missing `Protects` or omitting any test file carrying its approved scenarios, and every non-acceptance task declaring `Protects`: the task-block grammar cannot infer task type, so a static check cannot establish this requirement. Check that the declared paths are repo-relative test files that exist or are created by the acceptance task, cover those scenarios, and are not assigned to later implementation edits. A wrong test oracle is a significant design issue requiring a developer-reviewed TDD revision, not an implementation fix.
5. **Check each task is independently verifiable.** Confirm each task names concrete file and symbol targets, distinguishing an edit to existing code from an approved planned creation; states a bounded change tied to its TDD reference; and gives observable acceptance with a narrow verification command or concrete exercise and its expected result. Flag a verification that asserts only that the code builds, compiles, or has no errors, or a manual "looks good" with no reproducible check, because none of these confirm the changed behavior. Verify existing targets against accessible source; treat an unverifiable target as a coverage limit unless the plan presents it as existing.
6. **Check verification prerequisites are available when the task runs.** Confirm every fixture, tool, data, or predecessor output a task's verification needs exists within the task itself, the existing repository, or a named predecessor task. Flag a check that cannot run at the task's completion because its prerequisite lives only in a later task.
7. **Check independence and shared-file ownership.** Confirm tasks the plan treats as concurrent have compatible file and contract ownership, or an explicit ordered handoff names which task runs first and the state it leaves behind. Flag an unstated shared-file conflict between tasks the graph marks ready together, and a hidden dependency that would in fact block a task the graph presents as ready. Where the plan claims parallelism, confirm the dependency edges actually permit it.
8. **Check that decomposition serves independent delivery.** Confirm each task ends in observable or persisted state a successor can consume, and that its exit state does not depend on a later task's output. Flag a task that bundles unrelated changes so that it cannot be verified as one unit, or whose exit state is undefined. Do not impose a task-size limit, a day estimate, or a preferred slicing the contract does not require; judge decomposition by independent verifiability, not by length.
9. **Check that no task introduces a new product or architecture decision.** Flag a task that redesigns a component, changes a TDD interface, adds a new failure or validation rule the design did not decide, or alters observable behavior beyond the approved design. Planning divides decided work; it does not authorize changing it. Return such a choice to the owning document and developer as a focused question rather than letting a task settle it.
10. **Check for placeholders and integrated acceptance.** Flag a task that appears complete but leaves behavior unimplemented, such as "add validation" without stating what is validated or "prepare for refactoring" without concrete targets. Confirm the plan includes integrated feature acceptance exercising the end-to-end behavior and the repository's required final verification, rather than ending at the last unit of code.
11. **Report only supported defects.** Quote the candidate at the exact location and quote the TDD or repository evidence when the finding depends on it. For an omission, name the applicable TDD obligation or contract rule and the plan sections inspected. Keep distinct defects separate; merge only the same underlying defect and correction. Separate unresolved questions and coverage limits from findings, and allow zero findings.
12. **Preserve review independence.** For an independent first pass, do not use prior findings, dispositions, author identity, desired verdict, or issue totals. If that context was visible, label the review as a follow-up. Do not praise, edit, implement, execute tasks, dispose of feedback, or imply approval.

## Output

Before writing any message, report, or question to the developer, read [communication rules](../guides/communication-policy.md#rules).

Open with the target path/revision, the source TDD path/revision, review scope, canonical count of unique unresolved supported findings, and whether the pass is independent. Then provide:

- **Coverage:** the derived requirement-to-task map, the dependency graph inspected, sources and repository evidence inspected, and precise checks limited by unavailable material.
- **Findings:** supported defects in canonical finding form: stable ID, severity, exact location, candidate evidence, governing evidence when applicable, practical downstream consequence, and smallest correction or focused decision question.
- **Questions:** consequential unknowns not established as defects.
- **Coverage limits:** unavailable evidence and exactly which checks it prevents.
- **Next action:** one concrete revision, source retrieval, focused decision, or rereview step. Do not imply acceptance.
