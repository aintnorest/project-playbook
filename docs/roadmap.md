# Roadmap

<!-- What goes in each section, and how items move between them: see "Roadmap" in the Project Playbook's guides/product-documentation-process.md. -->

## Status

This roadmap records current priorities and later opportunities. Developer approval activates it; record the actual approval date in frontmatter when that occurs.

## Now

## Next

- **Pinned read-only install.** Consumers need confidence that an immutable, pinned Playbook copy works with `--no-extensions --extension <copy>/omp-extension.ts` in a sandbox that denies writes to the copy: agents, skills, and all three tools must load. Python checkers must not write into the install, including `__pycache__`, and nothing may assume the checkout is writable or is the working repository.
- **Plan progress reporting.** A supervising tool cannot reliably show task progress if it must parse the run ledger. A harness-neutral contract would let the execution owner report each task's state as execution proceeds.
- **Document-status migration.** Older repository documents lack the status frontmatter needed to establish their authority. A guided migration would let an agent propose state, revision, and acceptance date from evidence for the developer to confirm.

## Later

- **Repositories that aren't products.** Repositories holding no product documents need a way to declare that scope so agents do not propose product documents there. This opportunity remains pending the developer's decision.
- Per-finding review reporting: a tool through which reviewers publish each finding’s ID, severity and location so a supervising tool can track responses to individual findings; designed when such a consumer defines its need.

## Done
